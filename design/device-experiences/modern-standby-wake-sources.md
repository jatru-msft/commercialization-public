# Modern standby wake sources


A PC that supports the modern standby power model must be capable of waking from standby in response to certain events, even if the platform has entered a very low-power idle state.

This topic describes the scenarios in which the devices in this PC must be able to wake the processor. It also explains which wake events should turn the screen on and which wake events should allow the screen to stay turned off. System integrators should use this information to ensure that their hardware platforms, firmware, and software can configure wake sources to achieve the required behavior.

## Overview of modern standby user experience for wake


The modern standby user experience is designed to model that of a cellular phone. When users finish using their phones, they press the system power button and the cell phone turns off. The phone remains off until the user presses the power button again, or a phone call, email, or instant message is received.

Similarly, when a PC is in modern standby, it looks and feels off—the screen is blanked, the system has no visible LED indicators, and there is no acoustic noise. However, a PC in modern standby remains on and connected to the Internet, just as the cell phone remains connected to the cellular network. (The modern standby PC uses any available network connection—Wi-Fi, mobile broadband (MBB)/cellular, or wired Ethernet.) And the modern standby PC, connected or not also has very long battery life in its off state, just like a cell phone.

Enabling the modern standby user experience requires all of the devices and software in the modern standby PC to actively and correctly participate in system power management. Achieving long standby battery life is primarily a function of allowing all devices, plus the core silicon or System on a Chip (SoC), to enter a very low-power idle state. During modern standby, the networking subsystem stays connected so that the system can wake and instantly respond to incoming emails or VOIP calls. Enabling the real-time nature of modern standby is primarily a function of platform devices waking the SoC for the correct events at the correct times.

Nearly all devices in the modern standby PC are expected to be capable of waking the SoC from its deepest idle power state. However, few devices should be capable of generating a wake signal for an event that would cause the system display to turn on. The difference between waking the SoC and turning on the display is at the center of delivering the modern standby user experience. The following rules govern platform wake behavior:

-   Only wake events that are user-initiated cause the system to turn on the display.
-   Wake source operation and scenarios are the same for all modern standby PCs, regardless of whether they are based on the x86 or ARM processor architecture.
-   Wake source operation and scenarios are the same for all modern standby PCs, regardless of whether they are based on the x86 or ARM processor architecture.
-   Wake source operation and scenarios are the same across all form factors, including slate, convertible tablet, clamshell, and docked slate.
-   Wake source operation and scenarios do not change between AC and battery-powered states. To deliver a consistent user experience, the guidelines in this section apply equally to when the system is on AC power and on battery power.

The remainder of this topic describes, for each device type, whether a device should be capable of waking the SoC from a deep idle state. Also described are the wake mechanisms for these devices, and whether the driver and system software will turn on the display in response to the wake event.

## Real-time clock (RTC) or always-on timer


The core silicon or SoC chip in a modern standby platform has one or more timers that are always powered on that so that Windows can schedule future work and place the SoC into a deep idle state. During standby, the always-on timer reliably wakes the SoC as programmed by the OS.

<td><p>Each SoC has a different mechanism for programming the always-on timer.</p></td>

</tbody>

## Buttons


The system power button is the most common user-initiated wake source in a modern standby platform. All modern standby PCs must be designed so that the power button is always enabled to send a wake interrupt to the SoC. To deliver an instant-on experience, the power button must cause the SoC to wake from the deepest idle state without delay.

Modern standby PCs might feature other system buttons, including rotation-lock and volume up/down buttons.

If the tablet has a cover, the sensor for detecting cover closing is also treated as a lid switch.</p>

## Communications devices


The Wi-Fi and mobile broadband (MBB) devices are responsible for delivering the real-time and constant connectivity features of modern standby.

**Note**  Windows can turn on the display when an incoming critical alert or activity is detected over the Wi-Fi network. Examples include notifications from lock-screen applications and VOIP calls.

**Note**  The interrupt mechanism is determined by the type of bus. For example, if Wi-Fi radio, MBB radio, or Bluetooth radio is connected via USB, it would use USB in-band resume signaling.

## Input devices


We recommend using HIDI2C for input peripherals whenever possible, but this is not a requirement. If necessary, USB can be used to connect to an input device such as a touchpad, touch digitizer, or pen digitizer. A precision touchpad must be capable of waking the system from deep idle, regardless of whether this device is connected to USB or I2C. As an option, a non-precision touchpad can wake the system from deep idle. Touch digitizers and pen digitizers must not wake the system from deep idle.

In addition to buttons on the chassis, a modern standby PC might have other input devices physically integrated into the system or attached to the system directly or indirectly through a dock. When the user generates input through an input device, it must always wake the SoC from the deepest idle state and cause the display to turn on.

## Insertion or removal of a connector or device


In addition to buttons on the chassis, a modern standby PC may have other input devices that are physically integrated into the system, or are attached to the system directly or indirectly through a dock. When the user generates input through an input device, this event must always wake the SoC from the deepest idle state and cause the display to turn on.
